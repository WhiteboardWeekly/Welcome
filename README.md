Begining January 2018, Whiteboard Weekly will be a selection of interview-style programming questions covering topics accross software engineering and computer science. Each issue will consist of a curated list of the top answers submitted by **you, the readers**, accompanied by a new question for the following week.

**We want your submissions!** Question submissions are live at [this address](mailto:suggest@whiteboardweekly.com). Answers will be submitted via Github once we are up and running. If included in an issue your name and social-handle of choice will be given credit, so be sure to include them!

We are hammering out the details, check back here for updates as we gear up for our first issue.
